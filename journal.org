** June
*** 10
    - Made repo on github
    - Created jsonnet to make tf config for a k8s cluster on gcloud
    - Created projects, service accounts etc. for gcloud in order for tf to run
      - Not sure I really understand the intended relationships between
        organisations, projects, etc. - need to read up on this.
    - Used the tf config to make a (single, tiny node) k8s cluster on gke.
*** 11
    - sorted out Pelican config for generating static web content
    - nginx docker image built to server static content
    - basic k8s infrastructure for load balancer + deployment for nginx
    - static content served correctly
    - in fiddling about with permissions tf is now not quite working properly -
      it deploys resources OK, but then errors after the event with: 'Error:
      Error reading instance group manager returned as an instance group URL:
      "googleapi: Error 403: Required 'compute.instanceGroupManagers.get'
       permission for
      'projects/xamaral/zones/europe-west2-a/instanceGroupManagers/gke-xamaral-xamaral-k8s-node-pool-e4f88150-grp',
      forbidden"'

      I don't really know what's going on here. I need to spend more time on
      the whole service accounts / roles / permissions stuff.

**** Up next
     - dns resolution for the load balancer
     - certificate handling
     - pelican configuration
     - get this journal served as part of the static site.
