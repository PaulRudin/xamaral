    - Made repo on github
    - Created jsonnet to make tf config for a k8s cluster on gcloud
    - Created projects, service accounts etc. for gcloud in order for tf to run
      - Not sure I really understand the intended relationships between
        organisations, projects, etc. - need to read up on this.
    - Used the tf config to make a (single, tiny node) k8s cluster on gke.
